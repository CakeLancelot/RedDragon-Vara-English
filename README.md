# RedDragon-Vara-English
A translation of the RGB/Macro software for the RedDragon K551 Vara/Mitra.
For some reason, there is only an English version of this keyboard's software provided on Redragon's website (redragonzone.com). I decided to translate most options required for using the software into English. If you have any comments or suggestions, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/CakeLancelot/RedDragon-Vara-English/issues/new).
# Installation
You must first install the Spanish version of the Redragon K551 software, available [here](https://www.redragonzone.com/pages/download).
1. On this Github page, click 'Clone or download', then click 'Download ZIP'.
2. Find where the installation of your keyboard software is located. By default it is in ``C:\Program Files (x86)\0\``
3. Extract the 'Skins' folder from the downloaded ZIP file into the software's directory, choosing to overwrite all previous files. This may require administrator permissions: if asked, say yes.
4. You are done! Follow the same procedures to install newer versions of this translation.
